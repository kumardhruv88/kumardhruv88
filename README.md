## 👨‍💻 About Me

I am a Computer Science undergraduate with a strong interest in **Machine Learning, Deep Learning, NLP, and Generative AI**.  
I enjoy building data-driven systems, understanding models beyond abstractions, and improving solutions through experimentation.

Currently, I am:
- Strengthening my foundations in **ML, DL, and Large Language Models**
- Learning **MLOps** practices to take models from notebook to production
- Actively solving **DSA problems on LeetCode** to improve problem-solving skills
- Exploring **real-world ML projects** using Kaggle datasets and open-source tools

I thrive in **collaborative and competitive environments** and enjoy working in teams where learning and execution go hand in hand.
